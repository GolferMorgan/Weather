# Weather

## Assignment
This assignment was particularly hard. We were tasked with retrieving a call from an API and using that call to display the current weather and 5 day outlook on our page. The current weather was very hard but the 5 day forecast was even harder. We have to set a for loop to call the time that we want pulled from the list elements so only that time shows up for each of the 5 days and then show the weather for that time block.
